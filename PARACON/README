To use this module:

1) Place the PARACON directory in the USER Module directory:

This module will download paracon from Github if a network connection is available and the software has not yet been downloaded.

A "PARACON" launcher will be placed in the menu in the "Other" category.

Paracon will be configured for your user.

Notes:
Direwolf must be running to serve as a packet modem. Please start Direwolf manually before starting paracon. Or, click "Retry" in paracon after you start direwolf.

In multi-user installations, Paracon will remain configured for a previous user, if the next user does not also use this module.
